Introduction

For this project we would be trying to divide a list of Pokemon into tiers based on how high their base stats are. Across the Generations, there have usually been cases of more Pokemon being introduced with higher base stat totals, we wanted to see if this was true, or if it was true for any other category. The main question we have in mind for this project is “Which Generation has the highest average base stat total?” 

About the Data

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and is titled “Pokemon Stats” by Ulrik Thyge Pedersen. This dataset is 60KB, has 13 columns and 1072 entries. The usability of the data is at 10. This dataset accounts for all Pokemon up to Pokemon Sword and Shield’s Expansion Pass (The other entries are for all alternate forms, such as regional variants, Megas, Gigantamax, gender, and other alternate forms). The 13 features include the Pokedex number, Name, two Types, six Base Stats, Base Stat total, Generation, and whether the Pokemon is a Legendary.
